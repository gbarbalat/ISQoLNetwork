Preprocessed data = ISQoL.RData  

First set of analysis = ISQoL_anal.R

Second set of analysis (independence between nodes and analysis taking into account potential confounders) = ISQoL_anal_indpd_confound.R 

5 imputed datasets with 11 nodes and confounders (inc. digit span) = df_mice_withMEMCHIF_MCI.RData
(Datasets are imputed because there are missing data in confounders) 

Input and output data of analysis taking into account confounders = anal_confound_all.RData
